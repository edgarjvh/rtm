                We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the
                security
                of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the
                internet
                itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission
                of
                personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the services
                within a
                secure environment.

        <div style="font-size: 16px">
            <p>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
                (“DNT”)
                feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
                browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and
                implementing DNT
                signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
                mechanism
                that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking
                is
                adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version
                of this
